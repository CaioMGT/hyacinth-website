# About HyacinthBots

Hello there! Welcome to the HyacinthBots website! Here, you can learn a little bit about our organisation, who are we,
what do we do and how do we do it.

The HyacinthBots organisation was founded in June 2022, initially named "Untitled-Bot-Organisation" because we were 
taking our time deciding what to call ourselves. We opted for the name HyacinthBots a few days later. The origins of the
name come from how Lily was named, which requires going back in time a little.

Back in the day, LilyBot was created for [The Iris Project](https://irisshaders.net). She was a single instance, single
server bot, that was clunky and written in Java. She was named "Lily" because it's the name of a flower, which relates 
to Iris, because Iris is a part of a flower. Jumping back to the present day, LilyBot is our primary focus. We absolutely
did not want to rebrand LilyBot in any way, so we thought about making our branding flower related. We 
bikeshed<sup>1</sup> the name quite a bit, cycling through quite a few flowers, even reading into the meaning of said
flowers quite extensively. Ultimately, we settled on the [Hyacinth flower](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hyacinth&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1440&bih=725&ei=_2rEY5DpOZiQ8gLstY_4DA&iflsig=AK50M_UAAAAAY8R5EPjsfhByheYmxAFVFuQg7inuk6_5&ved=0ahUKEwjQ5L_Nvcr8AhUYiFwKHezaA88Q4dUDCAY&uact=5&oq=hyacinth&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyCAgAEIAEELEDMgsIABCABBCxAxCDATIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgARQtAdY-Q1g3Q9oAHAAeACAAUGIAZADkgEBOJgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nsAEA&sclient=img),
quite a beautiful flower, if we say so ourselves. Our logo is inspired from the Hyacinth flower itself.

Upon naming our organisation, we swiftly transferred Lily into the organisation and began to work on building ourselves 
up as a community, moving into our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hy2329fcTZ) and begging to formalise proceedings.

As an organisation, Hyacinth has 3 core principles that are present in every project:
1. **Free**: All our bots are free to use, period.
2. **Open Source**: Everything we make, will be made open source on our [GitHub](https://github.com/HyacinthBots)
3. **Forever**: Our principles will not change. Forever is a long time and we mean it.


### Who is Hyacinth?
There are two founders and leaders of HyacinthBots. They're responsible for managing the infrastructure, website and 
guiding the direction for the organsation as a whole
