# About HyacinthBots

Hello there! Welcome to the HyacinthBots website! Here, you can learn a little bit about our organisation, who are we,
what do we do and how do we do it.

The HyacinthBots organisation was founded in June 2022, initially named "Untitled-Bot-Organisation" because we were 
taking our time deciding what to call ourselves. We opted for the name HyacinthBots a few days later. The origins of the
name come from how Lily was named, which requires going back in time a little.

Back in the day, LilyBot was created for [The Iris Project](https://irisshaders.net). She was a single instance, single
server bot, that was clunky and written in Java. She was named "Lily" because it's the name of a flower, which relates 
to Iris, because Iris is a part of a flower. Jumping back to the present day, LilyBot is our primary focus. We absolutely
did not want to rebrand LilyBot in any way, so we thought about making our branding flower related. We 
bikeshed<sup>1</sup> the name quite a bit, cycling through quite a few flowers, even reading into the meaning of said
flowers quite extensively. Ultimately, we settled on the [Hyacinth flower](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hyacinth&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1440&bih=725&ei=_2rEY5DpOZiQ8gLstY_4DA&iflsig=AK50M_UAAAAAY8R5EPjsfhByheYmxAFVFuQg7inuk6_5&ved=0ahUKEwjQ5L_Nvcr8AhUYiFwKHezaA88Q4dUDCAY&uact=5&oq=hyacinth&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyCAgAEIAEELEDMgsIABCABBCxAxCDATIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgARQtAdY-Q1g3Q9oAHAAeACAAUGIAZADkgEBOJgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nsAEA&sclient=img),
quite a beautiful flower, if we say so ourselves. Our logo is inspired from the Hyacinth flower itself.

Upon naming our organisation, we swiftly transferred Lily into the organisation and began to work on building ourselves 
up as a community, moving into our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hy2329fcTZ) and beginning to formalise proceedings.

As an organisation, Hyacinth has 3 core principles that are present in every project:
1. **Free**: All our bots are free to use, period.
2. **Open Source**: Everything we make, will be made open source on our [GitHub](https://github.com/HyacinthBots)
3. **Forever**: Our principles will not change. Forever is a long time and we mean it.


### Who is Hyacinth?
There are two founding members and leaders of HyacinthBots. They're responsible for managing the infrastructure, website
and guiding the direction for the organisation as a whole.

NoComment is the longest standing active developer at HyacinthBots. They began working on Lily during her Java days, and
during the Kotlin rewrite they became a prolific developer. The wild amount of code they wrote allowed Lily to hit the 
ground running when she first became a multi-guild bot. Today, they maintain multiple external libraries under the 
HyacinthBots organisation and attempt to do wild things with varying degrees of success. They also manage the 
infrastructure Lily runs on.

tempest began working on Lily shortly after the Kotlin rewrite released. Her first contributions were major 
cleanups and re-organisations of the code. An early and well-used feature she introduced was the Role Menu extension, which is used in many guilds to this day. Since her work here began, the codebase has become far cleaner. Her high quality reviews on PRs mean any wild code NoComment writes ends up tidy and (hopefully) bug free. These days, she manages financials and social media pages, while also 
providing reviews and intermittent but high quality code.
